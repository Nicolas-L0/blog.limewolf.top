###### DONE
- Configured _index.md to point to the home page.
- Set different navibar: title for different pages.
- Added Article, Projects, and About pages.
- Added a profile picture.
- Changed the blog domain name.
- Added the \themes\hugo-theme-monochrome\i18n\zh-cn.toml file to optimize support for Simplified Chinese.
- Addressed issues:
    - Issue 1: Disappearance of the list of posts directory page in `list` type after adding additional content (while the author's demo page displays correctly).
      - Solution 1: `[list_layout] enable_pagination = false`
    - Issue 2: The `static/favicon.ico` not displaying.
    - Issue 3: Default theme color value `dark` not taking effect.
      - Solutions 2 and 3: These seem to be related to the local hugo server and don't affect the online page.
- English support is complete, achieving a bilingual blog!
