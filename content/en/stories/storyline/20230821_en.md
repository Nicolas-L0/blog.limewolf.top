During a nap this noon, suddenly this phrase echoed in my mind:

> First complete, then perfect.

This was the advice my teacher emphasized when I participated in an e-newspaper layout competition in middle school.

Of course, this principle applies to practical tasks like creating a static web blog as well.
Lately, from choosing a web framework to selecting a theme, and then reviewing various configuration files and tutorials, it indeed took quite a bit of time.

###### Let's take action first! (DONE)
- Preliminary configuration of the navigation bar is complete.
- Created the "Site Journal" section and temporarily set it as the homepage content.
- Linked to the Onedrive cloud storage.
###### Record the current issues and solve them one by one in the future (TODO)
- I chose Hugo because it natively supports org-mode, but it seems that the monochrome theme doesn't adapt well to .org file format articles.
- Hugo offers high flexibility, but that also means a steeper learning curve. I plan to reorganize the logical relationships between pages once the content becomes more substantial.
- (Done in v.0.2)Bilingual support.
